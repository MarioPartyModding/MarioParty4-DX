# MP4DX: Mario Party 4 Item Expansion Mod

MP4DX is a mod of *Mario Party 4* that expands the game by changing its item roster to a whopping **36 items**. Does the Mini-Mega system get tiresome pretty quickly? Well, here's more items to play with to spice up the *MP4* experience!

### Key Features:

- **Expanded Item Roster**: 36 items to choose from!
  - **Returning Staples**: Items like Mushrooms, Golden Mushrooms, Skeleton Keys, and Plunder Chests, which were absent in vanilla *MP4*, are back. 
  - **Items from Mario Party 3**: Reverse Mushroom, Cellular Shopper, and Bowser Phone are now available.
  - **Items from Mario Party 1 & Newer Games**: The Mario Party 1 dice blocks and other items from newer entries in the series are included.
  - **Rare Items**: 5 rare items, including the dreaded **Wacky Watch**, can be obtained if you're lucky enough!

### Shop Rework:
- Shops now offer **7 items per visit** (up from 5).
- **Gecko Codes**: Several Gecko codes are included to allow players to modify the shop odds and prices at will.
  
### Item Space Changes:
- **Mushroom Spaces** are now proper **Item Spaces**. You can get any reward from them, not just Mini and Mega Mushrooms!
  - By default, you have a **37.5% chance** of getting multiple items (in the form of an item bag) if you don't have one and have 0-1 items. This simulates Item Spaces from *Mario Party 3*. Otherwise, you get a random singular item.
  - **Gecko Code**: A Gecko code is included to modify the odds of getting items from Item Spaces.

### AI Tweaks:
- The **CPU characters' AI** has been adjusted to better utilize the new items, and each character has new **item preferences**.

Enjoy an MP4 experience with a **wackier** item system!
